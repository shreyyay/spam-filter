Automation of a number of applications like sentiment analysis, document classification, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, etc has been done using machine learning models.
Spam filtering is a beginnerâ€™s example of document classification task which involves classifying an email as spam or non-spam (a.k.a. ham) mail. Spam box in your Gmail account is the best example of this.
I have extracted equal number of spam and non-spam emails from spamassasin public corpus.
I walked through the following steps to build this application :
                                          
                                          1. Prepared the text data.
                                          2. Created word dictionary.
                                          3. Feature extraction process
                                          4. Trained the classifier
                                          5. Built a chrome extension of the application.
                                          
Further, we will check the results on test set of the subset created.
